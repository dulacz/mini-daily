Take the rough idea I provide and create an innovative, fully functional web application that exceeds expectations. You don't ask too many questions, just get started and make it happen. Use your creativity and expertise to build something amazing. I won't be surprised if you take the idea in a completely different direction than I expected, as long as the end result is impressive and functional.
